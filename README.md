# Alg-Data-Structures---project3
This project builds on project one and two, but with the use of ADT List. Note: ADT List was fully implemented during this project - Refer to List class.

## FileNumber Class
This  class gets a two digit number from the user through the console or the command line.
The number inputted will be used in naming input files.

Method overloading was used on the getFileNumber method. Based on the number of arguments, this 
method will either get input from the keyboard or from the command line.
